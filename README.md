### Arduino environment  

Need to choose between Matlab w/Simulink environment that would be easiest to start the project in, or a Python environment that would be more portable.  

1. How much benefit would Simulink confer?  
2. Do we need interactivity between the host and arduino or do we just need compiled code?
